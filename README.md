# euler-problems
Purpose
going through the euler problems, see how many I can do and how fast solutions can get. Done entirely in python so far so not very efficient
Not all the scripts work. some run really slowly, the purpose is not to present the best code but to archive my own code.

Instructions:
can run any of the scripts in terminal
